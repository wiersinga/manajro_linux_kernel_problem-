# Bootloader Corruption and Kernel Not Found Issue in Manjaro Linux

## Problem Overview

When using Manjaro Linux (or other Arch-based distributions), users may sometimes encounter boot issues after a system update, especially if the update process was interrupted. One common error message is:


This error indicates that the system is unable to find or load the kernel, which is required to boot the operating system. The cause is often related to a corruption or misconfiguration of the bootloader, such as **GRUB**, during an update.

## What is a Bootloader?

A **bootloader** is a small program that runs when the computer starts. It is responsible for loading the operating system (in this case, Linux) into memory and launching it. Manjaro typically uses **GRUB** (Grand Unified Bootloader) for this task. If the bootloader is corrupted or misconfigured, it prevents the system from properly starting up.

## Common Causes

1. **Interrupted Updates**: If a system update (especially one involving the kernel or GRUB) is interrupted (due to a power loss or a manual stop), the bootloader or kernel files might become corrupted.
   
2. **Incorrect GRUB Configuration**: Sometimes, the GRUB configuration is not updated correctly, especially after a kernel update, which leads to the system failing to locate the kernel file.

3. **Boot Partition Corruption**: Corruption in the `/boot` partition, where the kernel and GRUB files are stored, can also lead to this issue.

## Possible Solutions

### 1. Booting with a Live USB

To resolve boot issues, itâ€™s often necessary to boot into a **Live USB** environment (e.g., Manjaro Live USB). This allows you to access your system, repair the bootloader, or reinstall GRUB without losing data.

1. Create a bootable USB with Manjaro (if you don't already have one).
2. Boot from the USB and select the **Live Session**.

### 2. Reinstalling or Restoring GRUB

If the bootloader is corrupted, you can restore it by following these steps:

1. Boot into the Manjaro Live USB environment.
2. Open a terminal and mount the root partition of your installed system. For example:
    ```bash
    sudo mount /dev/sdXn /mnt
    sudo mount /dev/sdXn /mnt/boot/efi  # If using UEFI
    ```
    Replace `/dev/sdXn` with the appropriate partition where your system is installed.

3. Chroot into your installed system:
    ```bash
    manjaro-chroot /mnt
    ```

4. Reinstall GRUB:
    - For UEFI systems:
      ```bash
      grub-install --target=x86_64-efi --efi-directory=/boot/efi --bootloader-id=manjaro --recheck
      ```
    - For BIOS systems:
      ```bash
      grub-install /dev/sdX  # Replace sdX with your boot disk (not partition)
      ```

5. Update GRUB configuration:
    ```bash
    update-grub
    ```

6. Exit the chroot environment and reboot:
    ```bash
    exit
    reboot
    ```

This process should restore the GRUB bootloader, allowing the system to boot correctly.

### 3. Kernel Reinstallation (If Necessary)

If the kernel itself is missing or corrupted, you may need to reinstall the kernel after booting from the Live USB. You can do this via `chroot` as follows:

1. Follow steps 1-3 to chroot into your system.
2. Reinstall the kernel:
    ```bash
    mhwd-kernel -i linuxXX  # Replace XX with your kernel version (e.g., linux65)
    ```

3. Reboot your system.

## Prevention

- **Avoid interrupting system updates**: Always ensure your laptop/PC is connected to power, and avoid manually stopping updates, especially those involving system-critical components like the kernel or bootloader.
- **Regular Backups**: Maintain regular backups of important data to avoid potential data loss in case a reinstallation becomes necessary.
